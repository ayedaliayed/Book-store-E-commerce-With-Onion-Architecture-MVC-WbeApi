Order Management:
Administrators have access to a comprehensive order management system, allowing them to track and manage customer orders efficiently. Order status updates, shipment tracking, and order history are key components of this feature.

Payment Gateway Integration:
Secure payment gateway integration ensures safe and reliable online transactions. Common payment methods such as credit/debit cards, digital wallets, and other online payment options are supported.

Reviews and Ratings:
